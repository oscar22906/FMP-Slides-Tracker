Hello wonderful friends i have created another very simple but also very useful tool. This time letting you calculate how many more slides you need and in how long. 

It is very simple and very effective.

Unfortunately, there is no fun mode.
This feature was exclusive to the countdown programme and does not return in this one. I dont care. Cry about it.

## Instructions
All you must do is download the .exe file. Either do this by downloading the source as a zip or download the exe from the release area. Its really easy just like click around and you will find it.

Alternatively you can watch the video I have made showcasing this programme:
